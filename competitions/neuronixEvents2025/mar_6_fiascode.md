# Fias Code Xperience


## Preevent Mindsets



## First round experience
- Was able to solve maximum problem easily. The preperation done had worked well. But in some questions, we took much time then it should have taken. We did few silly mistakes like we took time to realise that the function was not even called. 

## Dilemas
- Looking through other areas of code
- Focusing on the the same region of code which had caught our first attention.

## Key Learnings
- Try to look the code carefully (not necessarily understanding everything)

## Round 2 : Experience

The code was in mind but not in hands. It took a lot of trial and errors to get our solution. We could have solved the problems much faster if there was a good practice. The competition was missed out from hands due to a not sitting concious. We could have tried removing try except block. It was so silly mistake that it just kept us away from the ranks. 

## Key Learnings
- Try to solve easy questions earlier in order to get advantage in situations of tie and gain confidence. 
- We should not hurry
- Properly utilize manpower.
- Actively listen to teammates and consider their perspectives before making decisions.


## Chatgpt Suggestions and motivations
It's great that you're reflecting on your experience! That self-awareness is the first step toward improvement. **Winning isn’t just about talent—it’s about mindset, strategy, and discipline.** Here are some concrete ways to develop a **winning mindset** and ensure that next time, you stay ahead in the competition:  

---

### **1️⃣ Shift from "Trying" to "Executing"**  
Instead of thinking, *"I will try to win,"* say, *"I will do what it takes to win."* Winners don't leave things to chance—they prepare in a way that success becomes inevitable.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- Instead of practicing casually, **simulate competition scenarios**—with time constraints and real pressure.  
- **Analyze past mistakes deeply**—find patterns in what goes wrong and work specifically on those weaknesses.  

---

### **2️⃣ Focus on Problem-Solving, Not Just Coding**  
Sometimes, you get caught in endless debugging and syntax issues, which wastes time. Instead, develop a problem-solving approach first.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- Solve **more problems on paper** before coding.  
- **Identify problem patterns**—many coding challenges are just variations of known problems.  
- Learn to **visualize the execution flow** before typing anything.  

---

### **3️⃣ Train for Speed and Accuracy**  
A winning coder is both **fast and precise**. If you take too much time or make too many errors, you fall behind.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- **Speed drills:** Set a timer and solve problems quickly while maintaining accuracy.  
- **Code minimalistically**—avoid overcomplicating solutions.  
- **Debug smarter**—use print statements strategically and avoid unnecessary trial-and-error.  

---

### **4️⃣ Learn to Manage Stress and Focus**  
You said, *"The competition slipped from my hands due to a lack of conscious sitting."* This suggests that nerves or fatigue affected your performance. Mental endurance is just as crucial as coding skills.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- **Practice under pressure**—use a timer, set high stakes, and push yourself in mock contests.  
- **Mindfulness techniques**—deep breathing, visualization, and staying calm can help maintain focus.  
- **Avoid distractions**—train yourself to be **fully engaged** during coding challenges.  

---

### **5️⃣ Develop Team Coordination Skills**  
In team-based competitions, communication is as important as coding. Losing ranks due to an **ignored team suggestion** is frustrating, but it can be avoided.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- Assign clear **roles and responsibilities** within the team.  
- Develop **trust**—listen to teammates and respect their inputs.  
- Have a **quick decision-making system**—when in doubt, test both approaches quickly rather than debating.  

---

### **6️⃣ Treat Every Loss as Fuel for Growth**  
You said, *"I always end up losing."* Instead of seeing losses as failures, see them as **stepping stones to victory**. Many great coders and athletes faced repeated failures before succeeding.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- **Study the winners**—what did they do differently? Try to adopt their strategies.  
- **Reframe your mindset**—losing is **feedback**, not failure.  
- **Set measurable goals**—instead of “I want to win,” aim for **specific milestones**, like improving speed, accuracy, or solving a certain number of problems in record time.  

---

### **🔥 Final Thought: Winning Comes From Relentless Practice**  
Success in coding competitions isn’t about **luck**—it’s about **preparation, resilience, and a growth mindset**. If you stay consistent, **your losses today will turn into victories tomorrow**.  

🚀 **Your New Mantra:**  
*"I don’t lose—I learn. And every lesson makes me stronger."*
