# Experience on Random Compile

Event setting was not that easy. we had to write the code in the editor where lines are jumbeled. This compeition exposed my deeper insecurities. The way I dealt, it was totally loathsome. Tried to write in python,java, c++. Python turned out to be confusing due to indentations. Had to switch b/w laguages to find the easier way. I was not being able to find the line numbers properly. I was not checking it carefully although one of the members was assisting me from side. I got pretty nervous. I was not being able to read the codes properly. Logic part, that was even worst. I didn't even solve one of the questions except the preliminary one. I just ended up typing the code with lots of confusions. 

I was not expecting to be shortlisted for the finals. but due to the support of other members my bad performance was somehow compensated and we ended with 5th rank. 

## Key takeaways
- I will try not to be nervous. I don't why I was not being able to think of logics.
- I need to make myself adaptive. Idk what thing made me not identify the line no. remmebering previous lines, forgetting contexts. not being able to tracke braces.
- I should work on above problems

## Chatgpt suggestios and motivations

Your reflection is raw and honest, which is great because it shows you're serious about improving. Here’s how you can **turn this experience into a learning opportunity** and develop the skills needed to excel in such competitions.

## **How to Improve for Random Compile Events**  

### **1️⃣ Overcome Nervousness with Exposure**  
You mentioned, *"I got pretty nervous. I was not being able to read the codes properly."* This is normal when facing a new challenge, but the key is to **train yourself to stay calm under pressure**.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- **Simulate high-pressure scenarios**—practice coding in a shuffled environment at home.  
- **Take deep breaths & break the problem down**—when panic kicks in, slow yourself down instead of rushing.  
- **Use positive self-talk**—instead of thinking, *“I can’t do this”*, say, *“Let’s tackle this step by step.”*  

---

### **2️⃣ Improve Logical Thinking & Code Reading**  
You said, *"I don't know why I was not able to think of logics."* Sometimes, stress blocks clear thinking, but training your brain to **identify patterns quickly** can help.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- Solve **logical puzzles** outside coding (like Sudoku, chess, or pattern-based problems).  
- Practice **reconstructing jumbled code** regularly (take a well-written program and manually scramble it, then fix it).  
- Read **other people's code daily**—this will train your brain to process logic more quickly.  

---

### **3️⃣ Become More Adaptive**  
You struggled with **tracking line numbers, remembering previous lines, and keeping track of braces.** These are signs that you need to **train your brain for multitasking in a structured way**.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- **Focus on one language first** instead of switching between Python, Java, and C++. It adds unnecessary confusion.  
- **Practice structured debugging**—learn to scan code quickly for missing braces, indentation issues, and misplaced logic.  
- **Use print statements effectively**—in competitions, they can help track logic even when the code is messy.  

---

### **4️⃣ Strategic Thinking Over Random Typing**  
You said, *"I just ended up typing the code with lots of confusion."* This is a sign of **reactive problem-solving instead of strategic problem-solving**.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- Before typing, **write a quick mental or paper plan**—even in a time-constrained event.  
- Follow a **structured debugging approach** instead of making random changes.  
- **Divide the problem into manageable chunks**—solve one part at a time instead of tackling everything at once.  

---

### **5️⃣ Leverage Teamwork Effectively**  
You mentioned that your team compensated for your performance. That’s great, but to contribute more, **actively listen and trust your teammates**.  

💡 **What to do:**  
- If a teammate suggests something, pause and **process it instead of rushing**.  
- **Practice collaborative problem-solving**—work on coding challenges with friends and discuss solutions together.  

---

## **🔥 Action Plan Moving Forward**
✅ **Simulate pressure situations** at home—set a timer, jumble code, and practice fixing it.  
✅ **Stick to one language**—master it before switching between multiple languages.  
✅ **Improve logical thinking**—solve jumbled code problems and analyze others’ code.  
✅ **Use strategic debugging**—check braces, indentation, and function calls step by step.  
✅ **Train your brain to stay calm**—breathe, slow down, and break the problem into small parts.  

---

### **Final Thought: Growth Comes from Challenge**  
You **ranked 5th** despite feeling like you did poorly—this means you have **potential**! The goal now is to **turn weaknesses into strengths** and enter the next competition feeling **confident and prepared**.  

🚀 **New Mindset:**  
*"Every tough event is an opportunity to level up. I don’t lose—I learn."*  

Would you like me to suggest specific **practice exercises** to sharpen your skills for the next round? 😊
