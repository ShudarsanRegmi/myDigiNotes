# Basic Dynamic Analysis 

## Using Debuggers

- Malware analysts make heavy use of assembly-level debuggers because they do not require access to a program’s source code.
- Debugging in Kernel Mode requires two differnt and it is difficult to do so.
- WinDbg is currently the only popular tool that supports kernel debugging. OllyDbg is the most popular debugger for malware analysts, but it does not support kernel debugging.
- We can either start debugging from the entry point for the program which has not run yet. The program that is already running, even they can be attached to the debugger. All the program's threads are paused when it is debugged

>This is a good time to use VMware’s record/replay feature. When you step-over a function that never returns, you can replay the debugging session and correct your mistake. Start a recording when you begin debugging. Then, when you step-over a function that never returns, stop the recording. Replay it to just before you stepped-over the function, and then stop the replay and take control of the machine, but this time, step-into the function.
