> teach me sign magnitude form, 1s complement and 2s complement form. their basic airthematic(addition and negation), needs, etec. representing integer in each of those form.

Alright, let’s build this up from the ground level — we’ll go step-by-step through **sign-magnitude**, **1’s complement**, and **2’s complement** — the three classic binary representations for signed integers.

---

## 1. **Motivation — Why these forms exist**

Binary by nature only knows **0s and 1s**, so representing *positive* numbers is straightforward.
But when we want to represent *negative* numbers too, we need a convention.

For instance:

* A **4-bit binary** can represent `0000` to `1111` (i.e. decimal 0 to 15).
* But if we want **both positive and negative numbers**, we need a way to encode the sign (positive/negative).

Hence the need for:

* **Sign-Magnitude form**
* **1’s Complement form**
* **2’s Complement form**

---

## 2. **Sign-Magnitude Representation**

### Concept:

* The **most significant bit (MSB)** acts as the **sign bit**.

  * `0` → positive
  * `1` → negative
* The remaining bits show the **magnitude** (absolute value).

### Example (4-bit system):

| Decimal | Binary (Sign-Magnitude)           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| +5      | `0101`                            |
| -5      | `1101`                            |
| +0      | `0000`                            |
| -0      | `1000` (problematic — two zeros!) |

### Characteristics:

* Simple to understand (like decimal + and – signs).
* But arithmetic operations are **harder**, because sign and magnitude must be handled separately.
* Also, **two representations for 0** (`+0` and `-0`).

---

## 3. **1’s Complement Representation**

### Concept:

* Positive numbers: same as regular binary.
* Negative numbers: **invert all bits** of the positive number.

### Example (4-bit system):

| Decimal | Binary (1’s Complement)      |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| +5      | `0101`                       |
| -5      | `1010` (invert bits of 0101) |

### Negation Rule:

Flip all bits.

`0101` → `1010`

### Problem:

* Still has **two zeros**:

  * `0000` (+0)
  * `1111` (-0)
* Addition requires a special **“end-around carry”** adjustment.

---

## 4. **2’s Complement Representation**

### Concept:

* Positive numbers: same as regular binary.
* Negative numbers: **invert all bits** (1’s complement) and then **add 1**.

### Example (4-bit system):

| Decimal | Binary (2’s Complement)              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| +5      | `0101`                               |
| -5      | invert(0101)=`1010` → add 1 → `1011` |

### Negation Rule:

`x_neg = invert(x) + 1`

### Why it’s powerful:

* **Only one zero (0000)**.
* Arithmetic (addition/subtraction) works naturally — no special handling.
* This is why **modern CPUs universally use 2’s complement**.

---

## 5. **Range of Representable Integers**

For an n-bit number:

| Representation | Range                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Sign-Magnitude | −(2ⁿ⁻¹ − 1) to +(2ⁿ⁻¹ − 1) |
| 1’s Complement | −(2ⁿ⁻¹ − 1) to +(2ⁿ⁻¹ − 1) |
| 2’s Complement | −(2ⁿ⁻¹) to +(2ⁿ⁻¹ − 1)     |

Example (4-bit system):

| Form           | Range    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Sign-Magnitude | −7 to +7 |
| 1’s Complement | −7 to +7 |
| 2’s Complement | −8 to +7 |

---

## 6. **Arithmetic Examples**

### (a) **Addition**

#### In 2’s Complement:

Let’s add `+5` and `−3` using 4 bits.

```
+5 → 0101
−3 → invert(0011)=1100 → add 1 → 1101
```

Now add:

```
  0101
+ 1101
------
1 0010   (overflow ignored)
Result = 0010 = +2
```

Works perfectly — no special carry rules needed.

---

#### In 1’s Complement:

Add `0101 (+5)` and `1100 (−3)`:

```
0101
+1100
-----
10001
```

If there’s a carry-out, **add it back** (end-around carry):

```
0001 + 1 = 0010 (+2)
```

---

#### In Sign-Magnitude:

Arithmetic is complicated — you must manually handle the sign bit and perform subtraction or addition on magnitudes. Hardware-wise, this is inefficient.

---

### (b) **Negation**

| Representation | Negation rule             |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sign-Magnitude | Flip sign bit only        |
| 1’s Complement | Invert all bits           |
| 2’s Complement | Invert all bits and add 1 |

Example (for +5 → −5 in 4 bits):

| Form           | +5   | −5   |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Sign-Magnitude | 0101 | 1101 |
| 1’s Complement | 0101 | 1010 |
| 2’s Complement | 0101 | 1011 |

---

## 7. **Why 2’s Complement dominates**

* Single zero representation.
* Automatic wrap-around (modular arithmetic).
* Simpler hardware for arithmetic.
* Overflow detection is straightforward.

---

## 8. **Quick Summary Table**

| Property             | Sign-Magnitude | 1’s Complement | 2’s Complement   |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Negative number form | Flip sign bit  | Invert bits    | Invert bits + 1  |
| Zero representations | Two            | Two            | One              |
| Arithmetic ease      | Hard           | Moderate       | Easy             |
| Hardware efficiency  | Poor           | Average        | Excellent        |
| Range (n bits)       | ±(2ⁿ⁻¹−1)      | ±(2ⁿ⁻¹−1)      | −2ⁿ⁻¹ to +2ⁿ⁻¹−1 |

> +43, -43, in different forms

Nice — let’s take your number **43** and see how it looks in **sign-magnitude**, **1’s complement**, and **2’s complement** forms.

We’ll use **8 bits** (1 byte) for the examples since it’s the most common size for representing small integers.

---

## Step 1: Represent +43 in binary (unsigned)

To convert 43 → binary:

```
43 ÷ 2 = 21 remainder 1  
21 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 1  
10 ÷ 2 = 5  remainder 0  
5 ÷ 2 = 2   remainder 1  
2 ÷ 2 = 1   remainder 0  
1 ÷ 2 = 0   remainder 1
```

Now write remainders from bottom to top → `101011`.
Pad to 8 bits:
`00101011`

So,
**+43 = 00101011**

---

## Step 2: Represent −43 in different systems

### **A. Sign-Magnitude Form**

* Sign bit = 1 (negative)
* Magnitude = same as +43 → `0101011`

Hence:

**−43 = 10101011**

*(MSB 1 means negative, rest gives magnitude 43)*

---

### **B. 1’s Complement Form**

Rule:
→ Invert all bits of the positive number.

```
+43 = 00101011
invert bits → 11010100
```

**−43 = 11010100**

---

### **C. 2’s Complement Form**

Rule:
→ Invert all bits + Add 1.

```
00101011  (this is +43)
11010100  (invert bits)
+       1
---------
11010101
```

**−43 = 11010101**

---

## Step 3: Verify correctness (for 2’s complement)

Let’s add `+43` and `−43`:

```
  00101011
+ 11010101
------------
1 00000000   (overflow ignored)
```

Result → `00000000` = 0 ✅
So the 2’s complement representation works perfectly.

---

## Step 4: Summary Table

| Decimal | Form           | Binary (8-bit) | Explanation        |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| +43     | Sign-Magnitude | 00101011       | Sign bit = 0       |
| −43     | Sign-Magnitude | 10101011       | Sign bit = 1       |
| +43     | 1’s Complement | 00101011       | Positive unchanged |
| −43     | 1’s Complement | 11010100       | All bits inverted  |
| +43     | 2’s Complement | 00101011       | Positive unchanged |
| −43     | 2’s Complement | 11010101       | Invert + add 1     |
