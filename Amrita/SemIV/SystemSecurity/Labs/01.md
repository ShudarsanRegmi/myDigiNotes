>Directories typically have multiple links because of their inherent structure (. and ..), whereas regular files usually have one unless explicitly linked using the ln command.



### Checking for parent directory permission
```bash
ls -ld
```

## Changing the permission of a file

- u -> Users
- o -> Owner
- g -> Group
- a -> All

### Changing file permissions
```bash
chmod u+x file.txt
```

```bash
chmod g+x file2.txt
```

```bash
chmod o+x file2.txt
chmod o-x file2.txt
chmod o+rwx file.txt
chmod o-rwx file.txt

```

```bash
chmod a-rwx file.txt
```

## Using chmod number with permission
```bash
chmod uog file.txt
u = rwx bits (111) = 7
o = rwx bits (111) = 7
g = rwx bits (111) = 7
chmod 777 
```

## Changing permission recursively
```bash
chmod -R uog file.txt
chmod -R 444 file.txt
```
