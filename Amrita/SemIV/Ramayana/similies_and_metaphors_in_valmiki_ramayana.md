**Prompt 1**
```
What are Similies and Metaphors? Explain with examples.  don't make response too long
```
A **simile** is a figure of speech that compares two different things using the words *"like"* or *"as."*  

**Example:**  
- *Her smile was as bright as the sun.* (Comparing a smile to the brightness of the sun)  
- *He ran like the wind.* (Comparing his speed to the wind)  

A **metaphor** is a direct comparison between two unrelated things without using *"like"* or *"as."* It implies that one thing *is* another.  

**Example:**  
- *Time is a thief.* (Time is not literally a thief, but it "steals" moments of life.)  
- *Her voice was music to his ears.* (Her voice is compared to music, implying it was pleasant.)  

Both enhance descriptions by making them more vivid and imaginative.
