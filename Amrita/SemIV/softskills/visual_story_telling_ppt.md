"Visual storytelling relies heavily on how characters are portrayed, and one of the key components is the character itself, which often serves as the visual anchor of the story. The character’s emotions and motivations can be communicated without words, simply through facial expressions, body language, costumes, and colors.

For instance, in Pixar films, characters are designed with exaggerated facial expressions and dynamic body movements that help to express their emotions clearly. This makes it easier for the audience to understand how the character feels, even before they speak. Pixar does an excellent job of using colors and costumes to emphasize aspects of the character's personality or emotional state – for example, a character might wear bright, bold colors when they’re confident or dark, muted tones when they’re feeling down or unsure.

By focusing on visual cues, Pixar ensures that even without dialogue, we can connect with the character's emotions and storyline, which is a hallmark of strong visual storytelling."

"Plot in visual storytelling is the journey the audience takes through a sequence of images or scenes. This is conveyed through sequential images, cinematic shots, and visual pacing. Essentially, the plot unfolds step by step, guiding the audience through the story visually.

For example, in comics, films, and animations, creators use elements like panel layouts, cuts, and transitions to show how the story progresses. Each panel or shot serves as a moment in time, and the way they’re arranged or cut together helps to build the narrative and maintain the flow of the story.

In films, transitions between scenes can speed up or slow down the pace, creating tension or excitement depending on how the plot is unfolding. Similarly, in animation, smooth transitions and changes in camera angles can signal a shift in the story, revealing new information or providing emotional weight to a moment.

So, the plot is essentially the roadmap that takes the audience from the beginning to the end of the story, and it’s shaped visually through the way the scenes are framed and connected."
