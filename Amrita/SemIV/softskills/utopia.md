Essential Rights in an Ideal Society
âœ… Freedom of speech, education, healthcare, and privacy â€“ ensures dignity and individual growth.
âœ… Economic security â€“ basic needs should be met for a just society.

The Freedom Dilemma
ðŸ”¹ Should people have absolute freedom?
ðŸ‘‰ No, because absolute freedom can lead to chaos, exploitation, or harm to others.

ðŸ”¹ Where do we draw the line to prevent harm?
ðŸ‘‰ Freedom should be balanced with responsibility.
ðŸ‘‰ Limits should exist where freedoms threaten safety, equality, or rights of others.

ðŸ’­ Too much freedom â†’ Anarchy ðŸ†š Too much control â†’ Oppression.
ðŸ’¡ An ideal society must find a middle ground where rights empower people without harming others.
