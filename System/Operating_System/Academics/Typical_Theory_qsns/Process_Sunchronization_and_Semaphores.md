### **Introduction to Process Synchronization**

**Process Synchronization** refers to the coordination of processes in a multi-process system to ensure controlled access to shared resources. The goal is to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency by controlling concurrent access. Synchronization techniques like semaphores, monitors, and critical sections are used to achieve this.

### **Types of Processes**
Based on synchronization, processes can be classified into:

1. **Independent Processes**: These processes execute independently, without affecting other processes.
2. **Cooperative Processes**: These processes can influence or be influenced by other processes in the system.

### **Race Condition**
A **race condition** occurs when multiple processes access shared resources concurrently, leading to inconsistent or incorrect outcomes. For example, two processes (P1 and P2) manipulating a shared variable might overwrite each other's changes, leading to incorrect results.

### **Critical Section Problem**
A **critical section** is a segment of code that can be executed by only one process at a time to ensure data consistency. Solutions to the critical section problem must satisfy three conditions:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can execute in the critical section at a time.
2. **Progress**: If no process is in the critical section, the selection of the next process to enter it cannot be indefinitely postponed.
3. **Bounded Waiting**: There must be a limit on the number of times other processes can enter their critical sections after a process requests entry into its critical section.

### **Peterson’s Solution**
**Peterson’s Solution** is a classical software-based approach to solve the critical section problem. It uses two shared variables:
- **boolean flag[i]**: Indicates if a process wants to enter the critical section.
- **int turn**: Specifies which process’s turn it is to enter the critical section.

### **Semaphores**
A **semaphore** is a synchronization mechanism that can signal threads waiting on shared resources. It is an integer variable manipulated through two atomic operations: `wait` and `signal`. There are two main types of semaphores:

1. **Binary Semaphores (Mutex Locks)**:
   - Can have values 0 or 1.
   - Used for mutual exclusion.
   - Processes wait until the semaphore is 1, then set it to 0 to enter the critical section. After exiting, the semaphore is reset to 1.

2. **Counting Semaphores**:
   - Can have any integer value.
   - Used to manage access to resources with limited instances.
   - The semaphore is initialized to the number of available instances. Processes decrement the semaphore value upon entering the critical section and increment it upon exiting.
