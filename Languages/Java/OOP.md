## It is either static void func or public void func
```java
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

```java
  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }
```
