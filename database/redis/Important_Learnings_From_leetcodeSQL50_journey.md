# Important Learning from LeetCode SQL50 journey

- Use Self join with proper conditions to perform operations b/w rows.
- group by col1, col2 can have multiple columns for col1 but only a single column from col2
- Check for null cases too in the cases when the value can be optional such as bonus less than 1000, etc.
- We can modify the column in our way and group by based on the modified column (Transaction-I)
- When using GROUP BY, including a non-aggregated column that has the same values within a group won't cause an error, but it can lead to ambiguity. For clarity and best practice, either aggregate the column or include it in the GROUP BY clause.
- When using UNION with individual ORDER BY clauses and LIMIT within each SELECT statement, it's necessary to wrap each SELECT part in parentheses. This way, the LIMIT and ORDER BY apply only to the respective SELECT queries and not to the final UNION result.




# Technical aspects
- DATEDIFF() function two find differnce between two dates. E.g. DATEDIFF(activity_date, '2019-07-27') < 30
- coalesce() function to provide substitue values for null values
- year(), month(), date(), DATE_FORMAT(date, "%Y-%m"), etc.
- Aggregation function can be used even after having clause
- GROUP_CONCAT(column SEPARATOR order by column ',') for comma separated values between rows of aggregated columns


# Question I need to revise Again
-  1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I
- 1070. Product Sales Analysis (solved using cte, need to solve using subqueries)


# Some queries to Look again

```sql
select class from courses group by class having count(student) >= 5;
```

##### Bringing the grouped columns in a single column
```sql

SELECT 
    sell_date, 
    COUNT(distinct product) AS num_sold, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(distinct product order by product SEPARATOR ',') AS products 
FROM 
    activities 
GROUP BY 
    sell_date 
ORDER BY 
    sell_date, product;
```

##### Dangerous uses of subquery
```sql
SELECT 
    e1.employee_id,
    e1.department_id
FROM employee e1
WHERE e1.primary_flag = 'Y'
OR 
    e1.primary_flag = 'N' AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 
			1 
        FROM employee e2
        WHERE e2.employee_id = e1.employee_id AND e2.primary_flag = 'Y');
```


# Some Invalid Queries that my brain interpretes as valid

```sql
select num from mynumbers where count(num) = 1 group by num;
```

```sql
select user_id, count(user_id) as cnt from movierating group by user_id having user_id = max(cnt);
```

# Queries that looks odd to me but are actually correct
```sql
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
) AS unique_numbers;
```
```sql
# "Yes, it is not necessary to select additional counts or columns because SQL processes HAVING after grouping. This allows you to focus on the results that matter most. Embrace this insight—each query you tackle brings you closer to mastery! Keep going; you’ve got this
SELECT customer_id
FROM customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(product_key) FROM product);
```


### limit 1 : A Technique to pick the min and mad supported by sorting
```sql
SELECT (SELECT num FROM MyNumbers GROUP BY num HAVING COUNT(num) = 1 ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1) AS num;
```

### Some Dangerous looking queries encountered
```sql
select
    case
        when id = (select max(id) from seat) and id % 2 = 1
            then id
        when id % 2 = 1
            then id + 1
        else id - 1
        end as id, student from seat order by id;
```

```sql
(
SELECT name AS results
FROM movierating t1
LEFT JOIN users t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id 
GROUP BY t1.user_id 
ORDER BY COUNT(t1.user_id) DESC, name 
LIMIT 1
)
UNION ALL
(
SELECT title AS results
FROM movierating t1
JOIN movies t2 ON t1.movie_id = t2.movie_id 
WHERE YEAR(created_at) = '2020' AND MONTH(created_at) = '02' 
GROUP BY t1.movie_id 
ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC, title 
LIMIT 1
);
```

```sql
(
    select
        Users.name as results
    from 
        MovieRating left join Users
    on 
        MovieRating.user_id = Users.user_id 
    group by
        Users.user_id
    order by
        count(MovieRating.movie_id) desc, 
        Users.name
    limit 1
) 
union all
(
    select 
        Movies.title as results
    from 
        MovieRating  left join Movies 
    on
        MovieRating.movie_id = Movies.movie_id
    where 
        MovieRating.created_at like '2020-02%'
    group by
        MovieRating.movie_id
    order by
        avg(MovieRating.rating) desc, 
        Movies.title 
    limit 1
)
```

### Smart Solutions

##### Exchange Seats - Medium
```sql

SELECT 
    id,
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN LAG(student) OVER(ORDER BY id)
        ELSE COALESCE(LEAD(student) OVER(ORDER BY id), student)
    END AS student
FROM Seat
```

```
SELECT *
FROM Patients
WHERE LOCATE('DIAB1', conditions) = 1
   OR LOCATE(' DIAB1', conditions) != 0;
```

##### Delete duplicate emails
```
DELETE p1 FROM Person p1,
    Person p2
WHERE
    p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id
```

### Second Highest Salary or else null
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```
### Crafted by me

```sql
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from employee where salary < (select max(salary) from employee);
```

## String Functions in mysql

### MySQL String Functions Overview

1. **`CONCAT(str1, str2, ...)`**: Joins multiple strings together.  
   ```sql
   SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World'); -- Result: 'Hello World'
   ```

2. **`LENGTH(str)`**: Returns the length of a string in bytes.
   ```sql
   SELECT LENGTH('text'); -- Result: 4
   ```

3. **`CHAR_LENGTH(str)`**: Returns the number of characters in a string.
   ```sql
   SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('text'); -- Result: 4
   ```

4. **`UPPER(str)` / `LOWER(str)`**: Converts all characters to uppercase or lowercase.
   ```sql
   SELECT UPPER('hello'); -- Result: 'HELLO'
   SELECT LOWER('WORLD'); -- Result: 'world'
   ```

5. **`SUBSTRING(str, pos, len)`**: Extracts a substring from a specified position for a certain length.
   ```sql
   SELECT SUBSTRING('MySQL', 2, 3); -- Result: 'ySQ'
   ```

6. **`TRIM([LEADING | TRAILING | BOTH] trim_char FROM str)`**: Removes specified characters (default is whitespace) from the start, end, or both sides of a string.
   ```sql
   SELECT TRIM(BOTH 'x' FROM 'xxHello Worldxx'); -- Result: 'Hello World'
   ```

7. **`REPLACE(str, from_str, to_str)`**: Replaces occurrences of `from_str` with `to_str`.
   ```sql
   SELECT REPLACE('Hello World', 'World', 'MySQL'); -- Result: 'Hello MySQL'
   ```

8. **`INSTR(str, substr)`**: Returns the position of the first occurrence of `substr` in `str`.
   ```sql
   SELECT INSTR('database', 'base'); -- Result: 5
   ```

9. **`REVERSE(str)`**: Reverses the characters in a string.
   ```sql
   SELECT REVERSE('hello'); -- Result: 'olleh'
   ```

10. **`LPAD(str, len, padstr)` / `RPAD(str, len, padstr)`**: Pads a string on the left or right to a specified length with a padding string.
    ```sql
    SELECT LPAD('MySQL', 8, '*'); -- Result: '***MySQL'
    SELECT RPAD('SQL', 5, 'x'); -- Result: 'SQLxx'
    ```

11. **`FORMAT(number, decimals)`**: Formats a number as a string with commas for thousands.
    ```sql
    SELECT FORMAT(12345.678, 2); -- Result: '12,345.68'
    ```

These functions allow flexible manipulation, formatting, and analysis of string data in MySQL.
